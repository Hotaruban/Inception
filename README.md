### Objective
The Inception project helps you explore the principles of system administration by practicing virtualization using Docker. It teaches how to manage services in isolated environments while ensuring efficient interaction between them through virtual networks. By using Docker containers, you simulate a small infrastructure with different web and database services.

### Skills Acquired
Virtualization and Isolation: Creating independent services running in separate containers, helping you understand how to isolate critical services while optimizing performance.
Automation: Using Docker Compose and configuration scripts to automate the creation, management, and deployment of environments.
Security and Best Practices: Learning security concepts like TLS, managing passwords through environment variables, and handling secrets in containerized infrastructures.
